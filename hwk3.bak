;;Homework 3: Complex Data Definitions

;;*****FOLLOW THE TEMPLATES!!!*****

;;1. Write three examples of data created with the filesystem data definition.

;;2. Write the template for functions over filesystems.

#|
3. Write a function any-huge-files? that consumes a filesystem and a number (a file size)
and returns a boolean indicating whether any file in the filesystem has size larger than the given size.
|#

#|
4. Write a function clean-directory that consumes a filesystem and an existing directory name,
 and returns a filesystem. In the returned filesystem, any files of size 0 in the named directory
 should have been removed. All other files and directories should be the same between the input
 and returned filesystems.

You may assume that the given directory name is only in the system once and that it has no subdirectories.
 You do not need to use these assumptions if you don't want to
 (i.e., no loss of points for not optimizing your code around this assumption).
|#

#|
5. Write a function find-file-path that consumes a filesystem and a filename
 and returns either the path to that filename (a list of directory names,
 in order from root to the directory containing the file--but not including the filename)
 or false if the filename is not in the filesystem.

Assume that the given filename is only in the system once.
|#

#|
6. Write a function file-names-satisfying that consumes a filesystem and
 a function from file to boolean and returns a list of names of files for
 which the given function returns true (you don't need to include the
whole path, just the filename). You may find it easier to first write this
 function with a specific criterion (such as a file with a minimum size)
 instead of the function parameter, then generalize it.
|#

#|
7. Use file-names-satisfying to write a function files-containing that
 consumes a filesystem and a value and returns a list of names of files
 with the given value as its contents. You can compare arbitrary Racket
 values for equality using the primitive equal?.
